// ***** Exercise - Area of Circle *****
// create a circle object using the object literal syntax.
// should have a radius property that we can read/write to from outside of the object
// should have a area property that calculates the area of the circle, that property should be read only.

const circle = {
    radius: 1,
    get area() {
        return Math.PI * (this.radius ** 2);   // Remember the area of a circle is pi times radius, squared.
    }
}
console.log(circle.radius);
console.log(circle.area);
