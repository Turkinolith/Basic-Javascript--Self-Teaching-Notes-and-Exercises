// ***** Emptying an array *****
// how to remove all of the elements in an array

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let another = numbers;

// Solution 1
// simply reassign the array.
// If  it's assigned with "const" you can't do this, you'd have to use "let" when assigning it originally

// numbers = [];

// Advantages: Quickest
// Disadvantages: if it is referenced by anything else, it won't work.
// if there are no other references to the array then the data is hanging out in memory untill the garbage collectior is ran and removes it.
// so if there is another variable like above:
// then there is still a reference to the data and it will not be garbage collected.

// Solution 2 
// *** The most suggested method ***
// set the length property to zero, this truncates the array and removes all elements.
// numbers.length = 0;

// Solution 3
// Use the splice method. Below starts at the first element and removes elements up to the max of the array.
// numbers.splice(0, numbers.length);

// Solution 4
// Use the pop method
while (numbers.length > 0)
    numbers.pop();
// ** Not a suggested method as it has a large performance cost. **
