// ***** Built-in JS Objects: MATH *****
// see: https://developer.mozilla.org
// Math is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions
// It is not a constructor.

// EX: a useful property is Math.PI 
console.log(Math.PI); // returns "3.141592653589793"

// If you need to use math in your applications, just come back to the page and see what methods you can use.

//ex. Math.random(), using it like this returns a result between 0 and 1.
console.log(Math.random());

// if you want to make this to a given range just check the reference page and you'll see a seciton
// titled "Getting a random number between two values" it shows an exaple that you'd need a function that looks like:
function getRandomBetween(min, max) {return Math.random() * (max - min) + min;}
console.log(getRandomBetween(5, 10))

// Another useful method is Math.round();
Math.round(1.9) // 2

// Another is Math.max();  Give it an array of numbers and it'll return the largest in the list.
console.log(Math.max(1,2,3,4,5,6));
