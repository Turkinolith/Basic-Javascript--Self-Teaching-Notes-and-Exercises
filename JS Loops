Loop Types:

For
While
Do...while
For...in
For...of

All do the same thing, repeat an action a number of times, but there is a subtle difference in how they start and end.

For single statement loops-
for (initial_expression IE: let i = 0; condition IE: i < 5; increment_expression i++) statement;
*Like if's, a single line statement doesn't need to be in curls, more than one line does need to be.

For multi statement loops-
for (initial_expression IE: let i = 0; condition IE: i < 5; increment_expression i++) {
  statement;
  statement;
}

While loops:
Key diff between while and for is that in for loops, the loop variable is part of the loop itself but in while loops it needs to be declared 
outside of the scope of the loop.

IE (this simulates the above for loop)
let i = 0;
while (condition IE: i < 5) {
  statement;
  i++;
}
So, without this would constantly loop untill the condition is no longer true.
This allows things like infinate loops (IE: while (true)).
