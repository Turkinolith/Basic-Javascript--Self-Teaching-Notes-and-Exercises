Loop Types:

For
While
Do...while
For...in
For...of

All do the same thing, repeat an action a number of times, but there is a subtle difference in how they start and end.

For single statement loops-
for (initial_expression IE: let i = 0; condition IE: i < 5; increment_expression i++) statement;
*Like if's, a single line statement doesn't need to be in curls, more than one line does need to be.

For multi statement loops-
for (initial_expression IE: let i = 0; condition IE: i < 5; increment_expression i++) {
  statement;
  statement;
}
