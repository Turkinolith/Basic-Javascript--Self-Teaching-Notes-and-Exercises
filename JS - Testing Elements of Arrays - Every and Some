// **** Testing Elements of arrays ****

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// There are 2 methods in modern JS that are useful: Every and Some
// let's imagine we want to check if all of the elements in the numbers array are positive.
// note the tooltip of the every method, it uses a function with up to 3 arguements, value which is a number, index which is a number, and finally the array itself. all optional.
// This returns a bool, in this case true


// *** EVERY METHOD ***
let allPositive = numbers.every(function(value) {
    return value >= 0;
});
// This method is ran on all elements of the array. As soon as it finds an element that fails its test, it will stop searching.

console.log(allPositive);

// lets insert a negative value to show this.
numbers.unshift(-5);
console.log(numbers);
// And re-run the test and overwrite the allPositive value:
allPositive = numbers.every(function(value) {
    return value >= 0;
});
console.log(allPositive);
// Now it returns false.
// Note that as soon as the every function hits the false number, it won't check any further elements. 

// *** SOME METHOD ***
// There is a similar method called 'some' that checks to see if at least one value meets its check function.
let atLeastOnePositive = numbers.some(function(value) {
    return value >= 0;
});
console.log('some check is: ', atLeastOnePositive);
