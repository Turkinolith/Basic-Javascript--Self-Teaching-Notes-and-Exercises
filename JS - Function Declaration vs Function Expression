// **** Function Declarations vs Expressions ****
// Function Declaration
function walk() {
    console.log('walk');
}                           // Doesn't need a semicolen on a declaration at the end
/*

// Function Expression
let run = function() {};  // Needs a semicolen at the end because whenever declaring a variable or constant it needs a termination by semicolan.

// in JS functions are objects, so this is similar as setting a variable to another object.

// Anonymous Function Expression
let run = function() {
    console.log('run');
}; 

*/
// Named Function Expression
let run = function run() {
    console.log('run');
}; 
let move = run;  // now both move and run are pointing to the same object in memory. remember this is a reference now.

// Both of these are the same result
run();
move();
