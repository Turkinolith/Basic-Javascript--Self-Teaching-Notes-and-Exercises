let person = {
    first_name: 'Larry',
    age: 38
}

// Dot Notation
console.log(person.first_name);
//default choice, shorter, more concise

// Bracket Notation
console.log(person['first_name']);

// you can pass values into it, like for example a user might select a target property.
// we don't know the property the user may select, that'll be chosen at runtime.
// So, we might have a variable somewhere else like below:
let selection = 'first_name';
// we can access that property with bracket notation in a dynamic way like below
person[selection] = 'Mary';
