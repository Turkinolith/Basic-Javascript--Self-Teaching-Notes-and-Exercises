// This exercise is essentialy the same as the previous one, just the instructor wants both a constructor and a factory function make the things.
// Since I already did one, I just copyed the code and added in the new stuff.


// **** EXERCISE: Address Object ****
// create an address object with 3 properties:
// street, city, zipCode.
// then create a function called showAddress(address) that takes an address object and displays all properties along with value.


// Object Builder w Constructor Function

/* function Address(street, city, zip) {
    this.street = street;
    this.city = city;
    this.zip = zip;
} */

// Factory Function version

function address(street, city, zip) {
    return {
        street,
        city,
        zip
    };
}

// Function to Enumerate the Object
function showAddress(address) {
    for (let key in address) {
        console.log(key, address[key]);
    }
};

// Create the first Address Object
//const Bozeadd = new Address('1222 Temp Dr', 'Bozeman', 95718);

// create the address object with Factory Function version
const Bozeadd = address('1222 Temp Dr', 'Bozeman', 95718)

// Enumerate the Address Object Properties.
showAddress(Bozeadd);
