/* Use a constructor function to create 3 Price Range objects, like those found on Yelp

So, here is a barebones version of how I understood that instruction.
I made a constructor to build the objects and defined an array so that each object is stored together.
Since this is to function like a radio button toggle, I use the array to get all of the objects and set their status 
to "false" before setting the chosen one to active.

In my quick testing, seems to work out perfectly!

Things that I'd also assume it needs would be:
# A method to instruct web page elements of a type to hide themselves if they don't have the corresponding "priceRange" attribute.
# The minPrice and maxPrice properties would be expected to tie into an "averagePrice" value that would be assigned to the web page elements.
*/


const priceObjectArr = [];

function ConstructPriceObject(label, tooltip, minPrice, maxPrice) {
    this.label = label;
    this.toolTip = tooltip;
    this.minPrice = minPrice;
    this.maxPrice = maxPrice;
    this.active = false;
    priceObjectArr.push(this);
    this.activate = function() {
        for (let priceObject of priceObjectArr) priceObject.active = false;
        this.active = true;
        console.log(priceObjectArr);
    }
    this.deactivate = function() {
        this.active = false;
        console.log(priceObjectArr);
    }
}

const inexpensive = new ConstructPriceObject('$', 'inexpensive', 0, 10);
const moderate = new ConstructPriceObject('$$', 'moderate', 11, 20);
const expensive = new ConstructPriceObject('$$$', 'expensive', 21, 50);

console.log(priceObjectArr);
