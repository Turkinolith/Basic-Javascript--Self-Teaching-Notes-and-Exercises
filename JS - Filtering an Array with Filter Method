// **** Filtering an Array ****
// *** FILTER METHOD ***
const numbers = [1, -2, 3, 4, 5];
// Let's say we want to return only the positive numbers.
// again, like some, this uses a callback function that is testing each element of the array.
// This time, it will return a new array that is composed of the values that pass the function check.
let filtered = numbers.filter(function (value) {
    return value >= 0;
});

console.log(filtered);

// The filter method can be made simpler by also doing this as an arrow function
filtered = numbers.filter(value => value >= 0);
// this can be further shortened by changing the parameters of the function, since it is obvious we're working with the values of the numbers array.
// so, we chan change it to something like 'v' for value, or 'n' for number.
// not required, whichever makes the most sense.
filtered = numbers.filter(n => n >= 0);

// in the real world, we'd likely be working an array of objects.
// EX: on the yelp website, you can click the 'Open Now' button to filter buisnesses that are open now. This is one kind of filtering
// so if you want to build something like this, instead of an array of numbers you'd have an array of resteraunts, each would have opening hours, then you can
// filter by their opening hours and return that.
// ** This could be used to improve the filtering of my older JS exercise "Price Range"
